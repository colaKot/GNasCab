rem Build the Android app for the photo client (2026-10-09).
rem Scope requested by Tie Zhu: the photo client ships as a phone app only;
rem its desktop executable is deliberately NOT built.
rem
rem The Android SDK/JDK live under G:\work\_toolchain (zero-download pool),
rem so they are exported here instead of relying on the caller's PATH.
rem
rem --no-tree-shake-icons is what keeps the kernel from stalling on this project
rem (verified 2026-10-09: without it the same build hangs with an idle dartvm).

REM Gradle 8.12 rejects Java 25 and the machine default is 25.0.3, which fails with
REM "Gradle build failed due to Java/Gradle incompatibility". JAVA_HOME alone is not
REM enough because Flutter prefers its own configured JDK, so pin it explicitly.

REM Gradle 8.12 (the version pinned in android/gradle/wrapper, copied from the main
REM client) is below Flutter 3.47.5's minimum of 8.14. Upgrading the wrapper would
REM need a download, and this machine is on the zero-download resource pool where
REM only gradle-8.12-all is cached. Skip the dependency-validation check instead.
REM Note the main client's android/gradle has the same 8.12 pin, so any future
REM apk build hits this too.

REM  Do NOT name this variable RC. Windows treats RC as the resource compiler
REM path and CMake/Gradle reads it, so setting RC to an exit code makes the build
REM fail with "Could not find the compiler specified in the environment variable RC".
REM Same trap as using EXITCODE after & in a cmd chain. Pick a name nobody claims.
REM  Avoid parentheses in REM lines too: an unescaped ( or ) here aborts the whole
REM batch file with ". was unexpected at this time", even inside a comment.
